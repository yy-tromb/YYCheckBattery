Check Battery left and notify you every minite ( if battery &lt; 70 or battery > 90 )  
Also Thought if plugged  
  
## Use win11toast or plyer  
If on Windows, I use win11toast, on others, I use plyer.

## If you don't have any Python, [You can install binary package](https://github.com/yyhome-tromb/YYCheckBattery/releases/tag/v1.0)

## Require
You may have to `pip install schedule plyer psutil`  
if you are Windows 10 or 11, also `pip install win11toast`  

## Future  
I'm thinking of limits of toast or change frequency in case
